    Delete the .git directory locally.

    Recreate the git repostory:

    $ cd (project-directory)
    $ git init
    $ (add some files)
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m 'Initial commit'

    Push to remote server, overwriting. Remember you're going to mess everyone else up doing this â€¦ you better be the only client.

    $ git remote add origin <url>
    $ git push --force --set-upstream origin master
